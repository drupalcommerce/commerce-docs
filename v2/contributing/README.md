# Contributing

For some time development will happen on GitHub and will be using the pull
request model: In case you are not familiar with that, please take a few minutes
to read the [GitHub article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
about that topic.

Please take a moment to read the [Development Guide](start_developing.md) to learn about the process and the conventions used in this project.
