Shipping is enabled in Drupal Commerce 2.x with an external module
[Commerce Shipping](https://drupal.org/project/commerce_shipping). This
module only provides an API and plugins for flat rate (both per order and per
item) shipping functionality. As with Drupal Commerce 1.x, you will need plugin
provided by other module(s) for calculating actual shipping costs with shipping
services. Currently available plugins with status as of December 24, 2017:
  - Flat Rate/Flate per Item - Beta, included in Commerce Shipping.
  - [Fedex](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_fedex) - Alpha.
  - [USPS](https://github.com/mattwebdev/commerce_usps) - In progress, not yet functional.
  - Other modules/plugins such as Canada Post, UPS, Kiala have yet to be ported
  or created for Drupal Commerce 2.x.
