## Overview

By default your site will allow guest checkouts.
You can change this and only allow registered users to checkout and/or allow users to register before they checkout.
You can change this setting on a per Checkout Flow basis, so you can allow guest checkouts for some flows and not others as you need.

### How to enable / disable Guest Checkout

Visit the Commerce configuration page and go to the **Checkout Flows** section.
