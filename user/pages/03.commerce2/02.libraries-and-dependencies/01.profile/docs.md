Profile
=======

See Also: `Module on Drupal.org`_   \|   `Drupal 8 Issue`_

Provides the profile entity type used to collect customer information.
In Commerce 1.x, we called these entities “Customer Profiles” and for
Commerce 2.x we have moved to where the community has extended user
profiles to include fieldable entity bundles. Customer profiles in
Commerce 2.x will be entities and orders will link to revisions,
avoiding the duplication we had in Commerce 1.x.

The Profile module provides a fieldable entity, that allows
administrators to define different sets of fields for user profiles,
which are then displayed in the My Account section. This permits users
of a site to share more information about themselves, and can help
community-based sites organize users around specific information.

You can pull the latest from the repository on `Drupal.org`_.
