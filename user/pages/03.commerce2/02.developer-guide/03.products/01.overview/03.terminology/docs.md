The following is an introduction to terminology used in Drupal Commerce.

| Term  | What does it mean? |
|----------------------------|
| Attribute | Something about the product which creates a unique choice. For clothing this would be the color and size. A subscription may have monthly or annual billing options. |
| Variation | A product variation represents an option of specific attributes for a product. For example, the Large Blue sweatshirt versus the Medium Red sweatshirt. This is what is purchased and has a price. It has a sku that must be unique across all products and variations. |
| Product | The actual product, a sweatshirt, which contains all of its variations. Every product has at least one variation. |
