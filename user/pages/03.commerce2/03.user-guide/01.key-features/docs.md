## Currencies

You can import [multiple currencies](../02.setting-up-store/01.importing-currencies). Coupled with Drupal's multilingual and internationalization tools, Drupal Commerce provides localized e-commerce.

## Multiple stores

Whether international, multi-regional, or a marketplace, Drupal Commerce allows multiple stores that have a specific currency and supported billing and shipping countries.

## Order workflows

Not all orders are handled the same way. [Orders](../04.orders) in Drupal Commerce meet your order management needs. Whether digital, physical, or mixed each order can go through its own experience and workflow.

## Payments

Whether you use [Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/), [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or any of the [other many payment gateways](../../02.developer-guide/05.payments/01.gateways-providers), Drupal Commerce provides many integrations.

## Taxes

[Taxes? No problem](../07.taxes). Out of the box support for [EU VAT](../07.taxes/01.eu-vat), [Swiss VAT](../07.taxes/02.swiss-vat), [Canadian GST](../07.taxes/03.ca-gst), [US Sales Tax](../07.taxes/04.us-sales-tax) or other custom tax rules.
